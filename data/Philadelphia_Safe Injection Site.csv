15,fa13fs,707iutg,,,,submission,DowntownPhillyUSA,"Anyway, I do believe that in shitty times people need to unite. With like 3-4 different topics about the Safe Injection Site, I figured today would be a good day for this. 

We need to knock some shit off, especially on this sub. This whole transplants vs. lifelong is bullshit. Politics, which were made to separate us, is the place where I think a lot of this shit starts. I’m a lifelong resident. 35. Some of you transplants annoy the fuck out of me, but at the end of the day, it’s because you guys are so nice. Some of you truly believe that everyone in the world is terrific. I commend you for that. I can’t live that way, this city has proven that it cannot be trusted. 

With that said the holdovers and the transplants all have something in common. We are all here because we like it. We are all here because we think the neighborhood we are in is safe. We may have different ideas on how to keep them safe, but we all want the best for our areas. 

The SIS made me think about something. When I was a kid, Passyunk Ave. was what Broad Street looks like now. A couple stores, dead a lot of the time. Did have the awesome King of Jeans. It was most transplants/hipsters that revitalized Passyunk Ave. and it’s great now. 

What I’m getting at is, it’s really time to get together. This SIS was jammed down a lot of our throats, transplants who moved into a neighborhood because they liked it, and holdovers who have lived here, doing our best to keep it nice. The city, these politicians don’t care about any of us. They just want us to come out and vote. They sold us all out, the residents. We the people, are all we have. Time to knock the shit off and stick together. 

To the holdovers, it’s never going going to be how it was. Times change. This place, this neighborhood is still better and unique than any place in the world 

To the transplants, you belong to this now. This is yours now too. Stop looking down on those who’ve lived here.

The UK/Australian study that casted doubt on the efficacy of these sites was retracted from the medical journal it was initially published in (IJDP) due to ""methodological weaknesses.""

I agree with you about allowing weed to be consumed in public spaces- but equivocating that to supervised injection sites is a bit silly and not at all what me or others are saying.

The actual studies on the efficacy of these supervised injection sites seem to indicate that it's not ""a false narrative"", here are the receipts:

Having a safe, supervised site, where these folks are around medical professionals and have access to clean needles (but not drugs) will not destroy your neighborhood or whatever youre worried about! 

As for the bit about collecting samples from clients, I don't know about that but it sounds awful! and should certainly not be allowed.

This is just 3 links about increased crime in the immediate vicinity of a single site.

So this doesn't really support your claim, just points out a potential problem with the sites. And a valid one I'm not downplaying because I'm definitely kind of NIMBY about this.

I was just confused because it seems like you were saying that even though the problem was primarily a plague in one part of the city you wanted to have the safe injection site in another part of the city because funding was coming from financial backers that come from Society Hill and the Main Line. But also that rich peoples kids come to Kensington and that's why they want the site where there are the most drug addicts but then the site should be in University City or Society Hill because that way the problem could be closer to home?

I mean obviously I'm missing something. I'm sure it's a very logical argument, but I don't see what having people living in Society Hill donating money to put a safe injection site in a part of town where there are zombies on every street corner means that the site should now be in a part of the city not as badly affected by the drug problem?

Highlights:
&gt;[injection site]: The neighborhood’s main businesses shuttered decades ago, making way for poverty and pain of all kinds.

&gt;Before opening at 9 a.m. one morning this spring, two people who run the place huddle over a man slumped against the building.

&gt;Short term beds and longer term recovery services are located right upstairs in an affiliated center called Onsite. That’s part of the crux of this place, he says, having treatment and health care readily available.

&gt;“There were times in my past where I did want to overdose but I certainly didn’t go to Insite to do it. If you want to die you don’t go where no one’s died,” said Daniel Beaverstock.

&gt;They found a decline in rates of fatal overdoses around the facility and dozens of deaths averted annually. People were less likely to share needles, Milloy says. And drug users were more likely to enter a detox program and enroll in longer term recovery services.  

&gt;Even with these new spaces, people are still dying in the region. This spring an even more potent batch of synthetics made its way into the heroin drug supply. British Columbia experienced one of its worst months yet for illicit overdose deaths,162 in March, according to the Coroners Service.

&gt;Fok, the nearby business leader, says what came after Insite opened was hard to ignore.

&gt;“There is clearly a reduction of people shooting up in the back alleys. That’s not to say there isn’t any now, there will always be a few but, but the number has dropped substantially. We don’t see as many discarded syringes as they used to be,” he said.

&gt;“This is a welcoming sight. You don’t see people hiding behind your car in a back alley shooting up.”

Our society is already too hard to go from nothing to something without any handicaps, there is no way a person who has their brain permanently altered after years of living on the streets and doing drugs could ever come back from that. By providing a injection site, you are just prolonging the inevitable as hard as it is to say. 
2. The more ""casual' user who may have a home, some type of job, just does it on a bender or free time. These types should not be encouraged to do it somewhere where they know they will be safe. They do not want to become #1. This isnt really helping them because they arent the true addicts yet who are already dead men walking.

His pro-injection site policy needs to be looked at together with his mental health policy (https://www.yang2020.com/policies/mental-health/), as well as his freedom dividend.

1) Providing safe injection sites provides areas where people who are addicted can safely inject and dispose of their needles, versus throwing them on the street. I don't know where safe injection sites are going to pop up, but I'd assume they'd be in neighborhoods where there is already a high concentration of drug abusers, so it would get them off the street and into a facility, making the streets safer.

2) With mental health treatment, people who are on the streets because they are struggling with mental issues and addiction can get the treatment they need to become healthier and less dependent on these substances

3) $1000/month incentivizes people to stay clean (since they won't get it if they're in jail), get help, may provide a roof over their heads, incentivizes homeless shelters and aid workers to help them if they can get some of that $1000/mo. Currently, there is no incentive besides good will and charity to help these people. The alternative is to keep the current system and let these people be thrown into jail, which is more focused on punishment than rehabilitation, or overdose and die.",1568252400.0,1,False,2qh24,,,,0,,,,,,11-09-2019,18:40:00,,,,False,d2xkmq,1

The idea that now there's a safe place to ""shoot up"" for the people that have been driving down property value, making the area unsafe to live, and generally terrorizing Kensington with their addiction is overwhelming. 

Kids are seeing people overdosing in the streets on the way to school. 

The area is so impoverished, most residence can't understand why anyone would want to make it safer for drug addicts in inject their drugs.  

The streets are littered with needles. 

There is no empathy in the hearts of the residence for the addicts they see everyday. There is only disdain. They do not realize they already live in a special  corner of hell, and their fear and loathing is a cycle that makes it worse. 

In their minds, a place for someone to dispose of needles, that controls the environment in which these addicts suffer in their addiction, that reduces the amount of overdoses their kids see on the way to school is a bad thing.

It's a bad thing, because it shows kindness to those they believe should suffer. 

It shows charity to those they believe should not be in ""their"" neighborhoods. 

They don't even realize that as they scream into microphones about how they want to help, but not like this, the problem gets worse. 

Everyday there isn't a safe injection site there's more needles in the streets, more drug addicts shooting anywhere they can, and more kids watching overdoses on the way to school. 


People think drug addiction is a criminal issue and not a social one. 


One day all they residence are going to wake up and they'll be old, and their kids will be young adults, and they'll tell the stories about how they ""won the battle"" to keep junkies from getting help. And how they fought for ""their neighborhood"" and won. And how ""everyone"" is better for the dedication they had to not surrender. 

And their kids will go about picking up the scattered needles in the street.

Honestly, I don’t think any city has the resources or political power to solve the heroin epidemic, much less a poor city like Philadelphia. Heroin is a national problem and the solution is probably going to be a national policy that prevents people from getting hooked on opiates in the first place, provides help for the minority who want to get clean and waits for the rest to die from their addiction.

I think there’s a very good argument to be made that the focus should be on reducing the amount of harm addicts do to their communities and the clean and sober people who live in them instead of on reducing the amount of harm addicts do to themselves.

“Villanova, Gladwyne men arrested for theft, drugs

Radnor police arrested and charged Matthew Bennett, 22, of County Line Road in Villanova with receiving stolen property, conspiracy to receive stolen property, criminal trespass, possession with the intent to deliver narcotics, possession of a controlled substance and possession of drug paraphernalia.

Mark Nicoletti, 20, of Youngsford Road in Gladwyne is being charged with receiving stolen property, conspiracy to receive stolen property, public drunkenness and criminal trespass.

According to police, officers were called to the area of Godfrey Road and Radnor Valley Road in the Villanova section of Radnor Township April 22 on the report of a recovered stolen car.

While on the way to the scene, police were contacted and told that two men believed to have been in the car were running from the scene.

A Radnor police officer spotted the two men on the grounds of the Radnor Valley Golf Course. At the time of the stop, police said Nicoletti and Bennett were both visibly under the influence of narcotics.

Police say officers then conducted a pat down of Nicoletti and Bennett and found a needle in Bennett’s possession.

According to police, Bennett told officers that he uses heroin. Police later reported finding 18 bundles that included a total of 252 packets of heroin, 20 bags of cocaine and vials of anabolic steroids on Bennett. Police also said officers found nearly $3,000 cash on Bennett. Bennett was also found within 1,000 feet of a school, Notre Dame Academy.

Police said officers also found $740 and a Movado watch in Nicoletti’s possession. Police were then contacted by a woman on Meadowbook Road in Broomall and told that Nicoletti and Bennett had just left her home and they stole a Movado watch and $740 from her.”

It's not effecting my property value; the value of my home is skyrocketing. It is effecting quality of life, but I don't see addicts as a zombie scourge or an enemy to be rid of either.

Fact is, most people in this neighborhood are intimately familiar with addiction. We all have known and loved someone that was an addict. We know these are people, and we understand their struggle. We just had a neighborhood 5k last month called the pink elephant, it was to raise money for the children of addicts being raised by family members; and to celebrate the lives we've lost to addiction. It went right down Kensington Ave, and you were being cheered on by addicts and former addicts the whole way. Our community is frustrated, but generally not afraid of these people.

People like me are skeptical that we could police our way out of this situation. I've seen the hold addiction takes on people, and frankly getting arrested and going to jail doesn't stop it. Sending dealers to jail doesn't stop it. Many of the low level dealers are just addicts themselves, trying to support a habit. Every person I know that became addicted to heroin or OD'd needed fucking therapy more than anything else. And if we can figure out a way to get them services like that, rather than throwing them in jail, I'm all for it.

Philly has done a good job so far at keeping Center City rents mostly in Center City and staving off gentrification and displacement when compared to NYC (nothing against people who live in those high rent apartments and rowhomes).

And I think the conversation is pretty apt because clout and exclusivity seems to be a big factor for the op.  It's always said Philadelphia is a city of neighborhoods and that is very very true.  The economies of each neighborhood is different and compared to New York neighborhoods, are driven by the people in them for the most part.  I fear Amazon moving here, just like any other place tech companies have survived, will exacerbate the relatively low levels of gentrification in the city, especially in South Philly and Northeast Philly.  I don't want to see a Philly in 10 years where people our age are saying, ""man I remember when you could afford(enter noun) bla bla bla...and there used to be all these cool dive bars and house shows and mom and pop water ice shops and delis but now it's all Starbucks and high end frozen yogurt stores!"" On the other hand, a safe injection site means, or at least in comparable contemporary models, means less disease, less overdoses, more access to mental health care and less junkies on the streets so you can feel good walking through the neighborhood to get an affordable water ice with your kids three years from now instead of putting a gun in your mouth from day after day of them nagging you about how ""there's nothing to do in the stuffy suburbs."" :)

Whatever form these safe injection sites take, similar to a homeless shelter, it's not going to allow for disruptive and aggressive people to stay there, and will kick those people out.  You know who, as a group, tend to be waaaay more prone to disruptive and aggressive behaviors? That's right, drug addicts.  So maybe 85 out of every 100 people who show up just want to get high in peace, but 15 are angry, maybe don't have any drugs, are trying to score them in the center, get aggressive, have mental issues, etc.  So the facility kicks them out. Guess where they go? That's right, whatever neighborhood this shitty idea gets put in.

Wherever this thing gets put it's going to be a far reaching magnet to all drug addicts in the entire Metro Area.  Its the same thing as how homeless shelters draw more homeless people to an area than there were before it was built, and then a good number of them get kicked out, but they just hang around instead of going back to where they came from originally.  Just look at how suburban has changed in the last five years since they basically let homeless people treat it as a shelter.  Except this will be way worse as it's the only one in the fucking COUNTRY.

* Target doctors who are overprescribing opioids
 * I mentioned elsewhere and similar to your own comment in this thread that there are probably instances where opioids _should_ be prescribed and some people are more susceptible to getting addicted than others.  I'd like to see alternative pain-medications that are not as addictive offered where possible in addition to there being accountability and check-ins for people that are prescribed opioids.  The check-ins should be done by a doctor that isn't the one prescribing you the drug in the first place and somebody trained to spot the signs of addiction / withdrawal.
* Offer free mental health / addiction treatment
 * Also worth mentioning that maybe if you complete rehab / treatment, we also try to coordinate some kind of job / volunteer opportunity for you to start piecing your life together afterwards.
* Legalize Marijuana
 * Let's be real, this is not going to solve the problem on its own but I think it's a good step to show people there is a difference between drugs.  Just because they're both ""illegal"" right now, doesn't make them equal.  The people just looking for the high may opt for the safer of the two instead.
* Make an effort to cut down the street supply of the drugs
* Decriminalize usage
 * I don't think this should be the first step, but if we remove the threat of jail time for simply using and instead replace it with something else, maybe mandatory counseling or rehab?  I think that would be a better way to spend our tax dollars.

So stupid!  We don't need to offer safe injection sites to offer treatment.  That's consistently been my argument here my goodness.

&gt;  It also ignores that the benefit isnt purely getting people into treatment but the other economic benefits of stopping addicts from shooting up in neighborhoods, under bridges ETC.

This still happens, don't fool yourself.

&gt; So you mean its circumstantial evidence? I feel like we had this conversation before... except for the pesky fact that there have been studies done that have shown that bad drug policy, such as Just say No or DARE, did more harm than good. But lets not let facts get in the way of your feelings.

L-O-L

Show me multiple studies that correlate increased heroin usage in the past ten years directly with drug policies that have existed for a much longer time.

But lets not let facts get in the way of your feelings.

&gt; Some people are going to do drugs no matter what we do. Its human nature. The vast majority of people will see addicts going to these injection sites and say ""holy shit I do not want that to be me"". You could probably also argue that removing the stigma takes away some of the incentive to do it. If there is no social stigma against harder drugs, its not much of an act of rebellion. But thats just me speculating because I havent read any studies that looked at that yet.

I thought the whole point of injection sites was so people **didn't see addicts**?  Goodness.  The mental gymnastics astounds me.

&gt; I mean the article you quoted clearly says there are resources on site for people who want to get clean so I dont know what to tell you besides to read your own comment.

Vancouver is one example of a safe injection site.  There are many policies around the existing implementations which discourage the staff at these facilities from actively encouraging people to seek treatment.  Rehabilitation referrals are only brought up if the addict asks.

&gt;  for the record, im not all that invested in the idea of safe injection sites. I am invested in the idea of trying new things to fix old problems

Good!  Me too.  But I am against safe-injection sites and handing out heroin to addicts through some new-age drug program.

&gt;  Because the old is clearly not working. ""Tough on crime/ tough on drugs"" might get your dick hard, but its not solving anything.

Oh the irony.

&gt;So of the 5,368 individuals only 262 completed drug treatment. That's an incredibly low number of ""success stories"" 

Unfortunately thats how drug treatment works.  Its better than the alternative of not offering anything to these people though.  It also ignores that the benefit isnt purely getting people into treatment but the other economic benefits of stopping addicts from shooting up in neighborhoods, under bridges ETC.  Treatment is one form of success.  Reducing money spent on law enforcement, ambulances, etc is another form.

Let me reframe a similar situation:

Lester is fat.  Lester's doctor told him ""you need to go on a diet or you'll end up dying"".  Lester tried to diet but found it was difficult.  Eating healthy was working out great at first but always seeing fast food in public was tempting.  Eventually Lester relapsed and fell back into is poor eating habits.  ""The treatment doesn't work!"", Lester exclaimed.

There are a few scenarios from this point onwards.

Should we give Lester access to fast food and a place that he can as much as he wants, with doctors on staff in case his arteries get clogged or he has a heart attack?

Or

Should we continue to offer treatment - for both Mental Health and Addiction, so that Lester can get the treatment he needs to live a healthy lifestyle?

Or

Do we let Lester do as he pleases.  Only Lester is in charge of Lester's body.",1515622025.0,3,False,2qh24,,,,0,,,,,,10-01-2018,14:07:05,,,,False,7pi0tt,1

I'll be honest, I only think: how can a safe injection site benefit me, me as a person who doesn't do that kinda shit. And to be honest, it does have its own benefits like what I previously mentioned. On that alone, I think they are worth studying.


To be honest, I do have my own doubts that it would even work. But I would potentially support the idea to try it out in this city just to see how it did. Worst case, we cancel the program. But I do believe that this city won't get significantly better unless it takes that a risk. If it actually works, then it could absolutely be worth the risk, and if not, then we wasted money actually trying something.  My biggest hang up is that if the city does plan to roll this out, then they have to actually do it and give it a fair shot.

Conclusion: safe injection sites in a violent murderous drug ghetto is a terrible idea. Glad they came to that conclusion. People cite the Vancouver, BC site as some model without mentioning the fact that North Philly is the polar opposite of that city. It would only end terribly. Don't have an injection site in a poor neighborhood where people are willing to kill eachother to sell to the junkies coming from outside the neighborhood. I think the safe injection site should be in Kenneth square. That would be a nice spot for it. ",1495469603.0,20,False,2qh24,,,,0,,,,,,22-05-2017,09:13:23,,,,,6co3vu,1

Treatment has a lot of different definitions in medicine depending on what type you're talking about. Treatment can be a form of care, which are services done to benefit the patient, or it can be direct combat against a disease or disorder.

Neither of you are wrong exactly. If there is going to be any real progress there needs to be a willingness by the addict to recover and prevent themselves from relapsing. At the same time, there have to be medical professionals who assist them in that process. A safe injection site would be extremely helpful in providing both care *and* therapy by, at the very least, preventing them from shooting up with infected needles or laced doses.
